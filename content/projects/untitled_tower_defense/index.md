Project Description
{.detail-label}

This is not just a tradition Tower Defense Game. We designed 3 levels to give players three different game modes.

{{< deeppink >}}**1 - Untitled Tower Defense**{{< /deeppink >}}

Level 1 is a traditional tower defense game. 3 waves of enemies, 3 types of turrets, and 3 types of enemies.
Each turret can be upgraded once or sold.

{{< deeppink >}}**2 - Untitled Tower Attack**{{< /deeppink >}}

Level 2 provides players with an opportunity to control the attackers and to play a third person action game.

{{< deeppink >}}**3 - Unlimited Random Tower Defense**{{< /deeppink >}}

We implemented map generator in Level 3.
The map is generated by path finding algorithms and enemies after wave 3 are spawned randomly.
Unlimited waves and no winning conditions.

*Made with Unity.*
